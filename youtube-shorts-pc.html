  <h3>Today I will show you how to watch YouTube Shorts on your laptop/computer.</h3>
  <h3>First, navigate to YouTube and click the search bar.</h3>
  <h3>Type in "#shorts"</h3>
  <h3>Click on an appealing video</h3>
  <h3>Read carefully. Replace the part of the url which says "watch?v=" with "shorts" so "youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" would become "youtube.com/shorts/dQw4w9WgXcQ"</h3>
  <h3>Congrats. Eat your life away at these useless videos. You earned it.</h3>
