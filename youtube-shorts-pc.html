  <p>Today I will show you how to watch YouTube Shorts on your laptop/computer.</p>
  <p>First, navigate to YouTube and click the search bar.</p>
  <p>Type in "#shorts"</p>
  <p>Click on an appealing video</p>
  <p>Read carefully. Replace the part of the url which says "watch?v=" with "shorts" so "youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" would become "youtube.com/shorts/dQw4w9WgXcQ"</p>
  <p>Congrats. Eat your life away at these useless videos. You earned it.</p>
